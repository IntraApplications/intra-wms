### GitHub App Authorization vs Installation: A Quick Guide

**GitHub Apps** can either be **authorized** or **installed**, and knowing the difference is crucial for choosing the right approach.

### 1. **GitHub App Authorization**

**Authorization** gives the app access to your **personal account data** and allows it to act on your behalf. This is used when a third-party app needs to verify your identity or interact with GitHub in your name.

#### Key Points:

- **Verify Identity**: The app retrieves your public profile and, if allowed, private data like your email.
- **Access Resources**: The app checks what repositories you can access and interacts accordingly.
- **Act on Your Behalf**: The app can perform tasks like creating issues or commenting, but only within the permissions you and the app share.

#### Use Cases:

- **Single-Sign-On**: Verifying identity via GitHub login.
- **Acting on Behalf**: Posting comments or creating issues under your account.

### 2. **GitHub App Installation**

**Installation** grants the app **repository-level access**. You install the app on an organization or specific repositories, specifying which resources the app can interact with.

#### Key Points:

- **Repository/Organization Access**: The app gets read/write access to selected repositories based on the permissions granted.
- **Granular Control**: You decide which repositories the app can access, ensuring precise permissions.

#### Use Cases:

- **Repository Management**: Automating pull requests, CI/CD, syncing code.
- **Organizational Tools**: Enforcing policies or managing workflows within an organization.

### The Difference:

- **Authorization**: Tied to your **GitHub account**; lets the app act on your behalf for tasks like commenting or reading profile data.
- **Installation**: Tied to **repositories/organizations**; gives the app access to specific resources for managing repositories and automating workflows.

### Conclusion:

For **personal access**, use **authorization**. For **repository-level control and automation**, go with **installation**. You can use both, depending on the appâ€™s needs.
